[![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/boosting-3d-object-detection-via-object/3d-object-detection-on-sun-rgbd-val)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/3d-object-detection-on-sun-rgbd-val?p=boosting-3d-object-detection-via-object)

This is a implementation of DeMF (Fcaf3d based).


## Prerequisites
The code is tested with Python3.7, PyTorch == 1.9.0, CUDA == 10.2, mmdet3d == 0.15.0, mmcv_full == 1.3.8, mmsegmentation==0.14.1 and mmdet == 2.14.0. We recommend you to use anaconda to make sure that all dependencies are in place. Note that different versions of the library may cause changes in results.

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment and activate it.
```
conda create --name demf python=3.7
conda activate demf
```

**Step 2.** Install MMCV, MMDetection and MMSegmentation.
```
pip install mmcv-full==1.3.8 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu102/torch1.9.0/index.html
pip install mmdet==2.14.0
pip install mmsegmentation==0.14.1
```

**Step 3.** Install MMDetection3D.
```
git clone -b demf_fcaf https://github.com/haoy945/DeMF.git /mmdetection3d
cd /mmdetection3d
pip install -r requirements/build.txt
pip install -v -e .
```

**Step 4.** Install Minkowski Engine.
```
conda install openblas-devel -c anaconda
export CXX=g++-7
# Uncomment the following line to specify the cuda home. Make sure `$CUDA_HOME/nvcc --version` is 10.2
# export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.2
pip install -U git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine -v --no-deps --install-option="--blas_include_dirs=${CONDA_PREFIX}/include" --install-option="--blas=openblas"
```

**Step 5.** Install differentiable IoU.
```
git clone https://github.com/lilanxiao/Rotated_IoU ./rotated_iou
cd ./rotated_iou
git checkout 3bdca6b20d981dffd773507e97f1b53641e98d0a
cp -r ./rotated_iou ${path_to_codebase}/mmdet3d/ops/rotated_iou
cd ${path_to_codebase}/mmdet3d/ops/rotated_iou/cuda_op
python setup.py install
```

**Step 6.** Prepare SUN RGB-D Data following the procedure [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/master/data/sunrgbd).

## Getting Started
**Step 1.** First we need to train a image branch [here](https://github.com/haoy945/DeMF).
```shell
Please refer to master branch.
```
Or you can download the pre-trained image branch [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H0SGOSvfYU45ID38CvQohIyAUeAXm3Ra/view?usp=sharing).

**Step 2.**
Specify the path to the pre-trained image branch in [config](configs/fcaf-ca/base.py).

**Step 3.** Train our DeMF using the following command.
```shell
bash tools/dist_train.sh configs/fcaf-ca/base.py 2
```
We also provide pre-trained model and log [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DVCPN50qKkRRd9Ndtr6CXHYqnOuHs4f5?usp=sharing). Evaluate the pretrained model and you will get the 67.5mAP@0.25 and 51.1mAP@0.5.
```shell
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --master_port=$PORT tools/test.py --config configs/fcaf-ca/base.py --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT --eval mAP --launcher pytorch ${@:4}
```

## Main Results
We re-implemented VoteNet and ImVoteNet, which are some improvement over the original results.
 Method | Point Backbone | Input | mAP@0.25 | mAP@0.5 |
 :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
 VoteNet | PointNet++ | PC | 60.0 | 41.3 |
 ImVoteNet | PointNet++ | PC+RGB | 64.4 | 43.3 |
 FCAF3D | HDResNet34 | PC | 64.2 (63.8) | 48.9 (48.2) |
 [DeMF(FCAF3D based)](configs/fcaf-ca/base.py) | HDResNet34 | PC+RGB | 67.4 (67.1) | 51.2 (50.5) |
